This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

http://localhost:3000/ is currently a multi-language repl.
In order to get the repl working you need to add your api keys to /app/compiler/judge.js and add ```RAPIDAPI_KEY=your-api-key``` to a .env.local in the root directory

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/react to use web dev playground no config needed.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
